# Native cash-register workspace

The app uses GPUI Component through `gpui-component-uo = 1.19.0-pre` and its
matching embedded icon assets. GPUI and the platform crate are pinned to
`1.19.0-pre`. The previously resolved GPUI 1.23.2 changed `wrap_line` to require
an additional argument, breaking the component mirror's published base package.
Keep these pins together; validate upgrades as one compatible set.

Research sources: [the published component package](https://docs.rs/crate/gpui-component-uo/1.19.0-pre),
[GPUI Kit component documentation](https://gpui-kit.com/component/),
and [the GPUI publisher](https://github.com/iamnbutler/gpui-unofficial).
Exact input, button, theme, root, task, and focus signatures were checked against
the installed packages. The current upstream documentation has moved to GPUI
Kit; examples from that newer API should not be copied without checking versions.

The layout uses a shadcn-inspired neutral palette, rounded balance cards,
an aligned movement ledger, and a focused form. It uses Segoe UI for interface
text and headings, and Consolas for amounts. These fonts are
available on the validation Windows host; other platforms may use GPUI font
fallbacks. Controls reuse the library's interaction and focus behavior.
Sign-in uses a bordered form, navigation uses an underline tab bar, and
authentication, save, and update feedback uses GPUI Component alerts with
semantic status/error roles. Component APIs are checked against the installed
mirror rather than upgrading the framework to follow current Kit examples.

## Component integration

The shadcn inspiration is applied through the pinned GPUI Component theme API.
`src/theme.rs` configures shared colors, control states, typography, and radius;
buttons, inputs, selects, tabs, and switches use the native library's styling
and interaction behavior. Shared card surfaces use the current GPUI theme.
Page text and borders use the same neutral palette, while success and error
feedback retain distinct semantic colors.

The reference is Ghostex's [shadcn configuration](https://github.com/maddada/Ghostex/blob/main/components.json)
and [light settings palette](https://github.com/maddada/Ghostex/blob/main/packages/core-ui/styles/shadcn.css).
This is a native styling adaptation. It requires no React, Tailwind, new
dependencies, or GPUI package upgrade. Keep new controls on the existing
component library and use the shared theme for custom surfaces.

| Component | Application use |
| --- | --- |
| Form / Field / Input | Consistent field labels and spacing across sign-in, setup, cash entry, and reports |
| GroupBox | Company, cash handling, and printing groups during first-run setup |
| Settings / SettingPage / SettingGroup / SettingItem | Searchable settings navigation and grouped preferences |
| Select | A4/Letter paper selection and a searchable report-register selector |
| TabBar / Tab | Cash register, Reports, and Settings navigation with an active-page indicator |
| Switch | Automatic-update preference, using the existing persistence and failure handling |
| Tag | Open/closed status in the register header and report preview |
| DescriptionList | Separate labels and values for report-day cash totals |
| Icon / Button | Embedded icons for actions and register identity |
| Alert | Errors, successful saves, and update feedback |

Settings validation opens the relevant page so invalid fields remain reachable.
The paper selector and backup preferences participate in the updater's
unsaved-work check. The paper selector accepts only A4 or Letter.
Report registers are identified by database ID, so repeated
names do not select the wrong register. Sign-out clears the selector's contents.

Report shortcuts select Today, Last 7 days (today plus the preceding six days),
or This month (the first day through today), using the computer's local date.
They preserve the register filter. Changing dates or registers clears the
previous preview; generate the report again before exporting or printing.
Password inputs include a reveal button; submitting or signing out restores
masking and clears the password.

The website's newer DatePicker and Empty components are not available in this
pinned mirror. Date fields retain ISO text entry and backend date validation.
No new dependencies or framework upgrades are required for these components.

## Workflow

Company setup creates a local administrator account on first use. Subsequent
launches open the login page, and the ledger workspace loads after authentication.
Settings and Reports are available from the workspace navigation. See the
[company and reporting guide](company-and-reports.md) for configuration, exports,
printing, and the limits of local authentication.

1. Create a register by name. New registers use CAD.
2. Open a day. The date defaults to the computer's local date and remains
   editable in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Enter an explicit opening count.
3. Choose Cash in or Cash out, enter a positive amount and reason, and save.
4. Read saved days in the sidebar. Movements and sessions use 25-row cursor
   pages with Older/Newer navigation. Movements are newest-first by entry ID;
   sessions are newest-first by session ID. Timestamps display in local time.
5. Close the day by entering the physical cash count. Review expected cash,
   counted cash, and the difference before selecting Confirm & close day.
   Closed sessions are read-only.

An active session is selected when reopening the app. Data changes from another
instance become visible through Refresh. Closing checks that the expected
balance still matches the reviewed snapshot; if it changed, refresh and review
again. The UI currently assumes CAD and two decimal places; multi-currency
register creation and denomination counting are not included.

Amounts are parsed as integers to the cent. Invalid decimals, negative values,
and overflow are rejected. A successful write clears the relevant draft. A
failed write preserves the form. Retriable cash-entry errors retain the exact
payload and retry key to avoid double counting. Constraint errors allow the
input to be corrected. A successful save followed by a failed refresh is
reported as saved, so it is not silently retried as a new entry.

## Keyboard and state handling

Tab/Shift+Tab navigate controls. Buttons support keyboard activation; inputs
support the library's selection, clipboard, and IME behavior. Enter signs in
from either the username or password input. Ctrl+Enter submits
the current form; Escape cancels an auxiliary form. A closing count requires
two submissions, including the explicit review stage. Inputs have visible
labels and accessible names. Errors remain visible and use an alert role;
save feedback uses a status role. Busy operations disable mutation controls.
The form stacks above the ledger in narrower windows (minimum 860 × 640).
The app adds no custom animations.

## Persistence and background work

The app creates `register.sqlite3` in the user-local application-data directory
resolved by `directories::ProjectDirs` for `ca / Local / Cash Register`.
There is no sample data or automatic opening count. The development override
`CASH_REGISTER_DB` accepts an explicit database path, useful for isolated smoke
tests. It must point to a database owned by this application. The parent
directory is created if necessary.

The foreground view submits one operation at a time to a background-executor
task. A mutex serializes access to the retained SQLite connection. There is no
unbounded queue or persistent helper thread. Tasks are retained by the view;
database locking waits are bounded by the connection's five-second timeout.
If a window closes during a write, the database operation may still complete
atomically; its result cannot update a released view. Disk work never occurs
in render functions.

## Validation

```sh
cargo check --locked --all-targets
cargo test --locked
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Use an alternate `--target-dir` if an existing running Windows executable locks
the normal build output. Database/service tests use temporary files. GPUI tests
exercise setup, cash saving, invalid input, duplicate-submit blocking, closing
review, and rendering at both layout widths using the test platform. Native
smoke testing should use an isolated `CASH_REGISTER_DB` rather than real records.

On Windows, the final native accessibility inspection exposed an upstream
`accesskit_windows 0.33.1` invalid-window-handle panic during shutdown after
Alt+F4. Saving, closing a day, and reopening persisted records succeeded before
that failure. Treat native shutdown with active accessibility clients as an
unresolved dependency limitation; do not claim full platform stability.
